<h3>IMPORTANT / SETUP</h3>
<ul><li>Tested with Chrome & Tampermonkey script manager</li><li>After installing, you need to navigate to https://criptologico.com/tools/cc and enable the faucets you want to start the process</li><li>Most of the faucets have hCaptcha validation, so <b>you must have a hCaptcha solver</b>.<br>Check our discord if you need one</li>
</ul>

<h3>@ 3.0.33:</h3> FP Ptc auto closer temporary disabled due to performance issues
<h3>@ 3.0.31:</h3> Added FP Ptc auto closer

<h4>Auto Roll/Claim with simple Monitor UI</h4>
<ul>
<li>Automatic rolls and claims for faucets/PTCs/miners</li>
<li>Accepts promotion codes (http://twitter.com/cryptosfaucets, free roll shortlinks) for CF faucets</li>
<li>Simple Monitor UI on top of a website to track progress (claims, next rolls, promo codes) and customize the runs</li>
</ul>


<h5>Briefing:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The UI runs on top of https://critptologico.com/tools/cc
That site is a WIP and will eventually contain some ads (no popups). You can, of course, replace it with another URL, but please consider keeping it as a 'thank you' if you find the script useful/helpful.</li>
<li>All data displayed is stored locally through GM_setValue. Nothing is uploaded to the website, except for the LOG in case you manually submit it.</li>
<li>You must enable popups on https://criptologico.com/tools/cc for the manager to open the faucets</li>
<li>Auto rolls will trigger ONLY when the faucet was opened by the Manager UI
This is to allow users to navigate the websites without having to stop the script.</li>
</ul>
